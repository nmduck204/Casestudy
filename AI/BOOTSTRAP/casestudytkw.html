        This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.

    <div>
        This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
        <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>
        <h3>Quoted text goes here.</h3>

        <h2>Example lists</h2>
        <p>This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>First list item</li>
            <li>Second list item with a longer description</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>And this is an ordered list:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <ol>1. First list item</ol>
        <ol>2 Second list item with a longer description</ol>
        <ol>3 Third list item to close it out</ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>And this is a definition list:</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b>
        <p>The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page</p>
    </div>

        <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b>
        <p>Used to describe the appearance of Web content</p>

    <div>
        <b>JavaScript (JS)</b>
        <p>The programming language used to build advanced Web sites and applications</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Inline HTML elements</h2>
        <p>HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the <a href="">Mozilla Developer Network.</a></p> 
    </div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li> <b> To bold text</b>, use .</li>
            <li>To italicize text, use .</li>
            <li>Abbreviations, like HTML should use , with an optional attribute for the full phrase.</li>
            <li>Citations, like — Mark Otto, should use .</li>
            <li> <del>Deleted</del> text should use and <u href="">inserted</u> text should use .</li>
            <li>Superscript <sup>text</sup> uses and subscript <sub>text</sub> uses .</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.
